                <li>Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood. This includes some 70 million indigenous people</li>
                <li>Forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects</li>
                <li>As many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-based medicines for basic healthcare</li></p>

                    <h3>Why we need healthy soil</h3>
                    <li>2.6 billion people depend directly on agriculture</li>
                    <li>74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally</li>
                    <li>Over 80 per cent of the human diet is provided by plants. Only three cereal crops – rice, maize and wheat – provide 60 per cent of energy intake</li>
                    <li>As many as 80 per cent of people living in rural areas in developing countries rely on traditional plant-­‐based medicines for basic healthcare</li>

                    <h3>How we have affected soil</h3>
                    <li>52 per cent of the land used for agriculture is moderately or severely affected by soil degradation</li>
                    <li>Farmable land loss is estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate</li>
                    <li>Due to drought and desertification each year 12 million hectares are lost (23 hectares per minute), where 20 million tons of grain could have been grown</li>
                    <li>74 per cent of the poor are directly affected by land degradation globally</li>
